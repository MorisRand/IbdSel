* Usage with PyROOT
...(for, e.g., using test_candidates.py)
With current janky environment, do not compile C++ from within PyROOT! The "wrong" dynamic libs get linked in. Compile code from "plain" ROOT, then load the .so from PyROOT. This applies to things like test/FileFinder.cc too.

* Testing stage1
** Generating smaller input
- First 10 files:
scripts/prep_p17b.sh -f "head -n -10" some_tag

- Random 10 files:
scripts/prep_p17b.sh -f "shuf -n 10" some_tag

** Running interactively (one process)
newenv
bashlib/stage1_job.sh -1 some_tag

** Cleaning up
eval `scripts/clear.sh some_tag`
